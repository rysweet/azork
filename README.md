# AzZork 🧙‍♂️☁️

**The Azure control plane, reimagined as a Zork-style text adventure.**

AzZork turns cloud governance into a dungeon crawl. Your Azure subscription is
the dungeon; **resource groups are rooms**, **resources are objects and
creatures**, **RBAC gates the deeper doors**, and the classic Zork **Grue**
lurks wherever you forget to turn on the lights — that is, in any *unmonitored*
resource group. Governance hazards (public endpoints, unencrypted data, runaway
cost, unlocked resources, dark rooms) are what breed Grues. Harden the estate,
banish the Grues, and raise your governance score.

> It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a Grue.

## The metaphor

| Adventure concept        | Azure concept                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Room                     | Resource group (pinned to a region)             |
| Object / creature        | Resource (VM, storage account, key vault, ...)  |
| Exits (n/s/e/w/u/d)      | Navigation across resource groups / regions     |
| Dark room                | Resource group with **no monitoring**           |
| **Grue**                 | Danger: cost overrun, public/unencrypted, unmonitored |
| `look` / `examine`       | `az resource list` / `az resource show`         |
| `take` / `drop`          | Acquire / delete a resource (with confirmation) |
| `lock`                   | Secure: management lock + private + encrypted   |
| `monitor`                | Enable diagnostics / Azure Monitor (banish Grue)|
| `cast deploy`            | `az deployment group create` (bicep/ARM, mock)  |
| `score`                  | Governance posture (0–100)                       |

## Verbs (mapped to `az` operations)

```
look / l                describe the current resource group (list resources)
examine <name> / x      inspect a resource (az resource show)
go <dir> | <dir>        navigate: north south east west up down (n/s/e/w/u/d)
take <name>             acquire a resource into inventory (with confirmation)
drop <name>             delete a resource (destructive, with confirmation)
lock <name>             secure a resource: lock + private + encrypted
monitor / light         enable monitoring here (banish the Grue)
cast deploy [template]  cast a deployment spell (bicep/ARM, mock)
inventory / i           list resources you are carrying
score                   report your governance posture (0-100)
help / ?                show this help
quit / q                leave the dungeon
```

## Install

Requires a Rust toolchain (`cargo`). Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rysweet/azork.git
cd azork
cargo build --release
# binary at target/release/azork
```

Run it directly during development:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Usage

### Offline mock backend (default — no Azure credentials needed)

```bash
azork
# or
cargo run
```

This loads a small synthetic Azure estate (subscriptions, resource groups and
resources) so the game runs anywhere with **zero credentials and no network**.

### Real backend (optional — shells out to the `az` CLI)

Explore your *actual* subscription. Requires the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/)
installed and logged in (`az login`):

```bash
azork --backend az
# or
AZORK_BACKEND=az azork
```

The real backend maps your live resource groups into rooms and their resources
into objects by shelling out to `az group list` / `az resource list`. It never
runs by default and is never exercised by the test suite.

> ⚠️ The real backend performs **read-only** discovery. Destructive verbs in the
> game (`drop`) operate on the in-memory world model only — AzZork does not
> delete real Azure resources.

## Example session

```

  / /| | /_  / / / / / ___/ //_/
 / ___ |/ /_/ / /_/ / /  / ,<

AzZork — an Azure Control-Plane Adventure
=========================================
[backend: mock (offline) | subscription: Contoso-Dev (mock)]

== landing-rg (eastus) ==
The West Landing Zone. Cables snake overhead and a subscription portal hums softly.
You see:
  - portal (Microsoft.Portal/dashboards)
Exits: down, east, north

az> north
== web-rg (eastus) ==
The Public Web Tier. Wind howls through open ports.
You see:
  - appservice (Microsoft.Web/sites)
  - webstore (Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts)
Exits: north, south

az> examine webstore
webstore [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts]
A storage account with its container door flung wide open.
Status: PUBLIC | UNENCRYPTED | unlocked | ~$60/mo
A Grue senses it is exposed to the public internet, storing its data unencrypted, ...

az> lock webstore
You ward the webstore with a management lock, private endpoints, and encryption. A Grue recoils.

az> north
== unmon-rg (centralus) ==
It is pitch black here — no monitoring, no diagnostics. You are likely to be eaten by a Grue.
Exits: south

>> It is dark. You hear the slavering fangs of a Grue nearby. Enable monitoring (type 'monitor') before it strikes!

az> monitor
You enable diagnostic settings and Azure Monitor. Light floods the room; the lurking Grue shrieks and flees.

az> score
Governance posture: 55/100  —  rank: Apprentice Admin
Outstanding hazards: 9 (public/unencrypted/unlocked resources, cost overruns, unmonitored rooms)
Moves taken: 4
```

### Getting eaten by a Grue

Linger in a dark (unmonitored) room and act turn after turn without enabling
monitoring, and the Grue will eventually strike:

```
az> look

>> It is dark. You hear the slavering fangs of a Grue nearby. ...
az> look

>> Oh no! You have walked too long in the dark. A GRUE lunges from the shadows and DEVOURS you.

*** You have died. ***
```

## Architecture

Idiomatic Rust modules:

```
src/
├── main.rs            REPL, intro banner, backend selection, confirmations, Grue turns
├── parser.rs          command parser: verbs, directions, aliases (+ unit tests)
├── world.rs           world model: rooms, resources, hazards, scoring, Grue mechanic (+ unit tests)
└── backend/
    ├── mod.rs         Backend trait + selection
    ├── mock.rs        default offline synthetic estate (+ unit tests)
    └── az.rs          optional live backend shelling out to `az`
```

The `Backend` trait cleanly separates *where the map comes from* (mock vs. live
Azure) from the game engine, so the world model and parser are fully testable
without any Azure dependency.

## Development

```bash
cargo build      # compile
cargo test       # run the unit test suite (parser + world model + backends)
cargo run        # play with the offline mock backend
```
